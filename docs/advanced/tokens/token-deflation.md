# Token Deflation Mechanism

Token deflation is a mechanism that automatically burns a portion of tokens to reduce the total supply, used to maintain token value and incentivize long-term holding.

## Features

- Automatic burning mechanism
- Dynamic deflation ratio
- Multiple trigger conditions
- Burn record tracking
- Transparency guarantee

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Suppressing excessive selling

**Q: What are the types of deflation mechanisms?**

A: The main types include:
- Transaction-based burning
- Time-triggered burning
- Threshold-triggered burning
- Hybrid burning
- Dynamic adjustment

### Operations

**Q: How to implement deflation mechanism?**

A: Implementation steps include:
- Setting deflation parameters
- Determining trigger conditions
