# Solidity Basic Tutorial

Welcome to the basic tutorial for Solidity smart contract development. This tutorial will help you master the fundamental concepts of smart contract development.

## Basic Concepts

### 1. Contract Structure
- Contract declaration and version control
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
  contract MyContract {
      // Contract content
  }
  ```
- State variable declaration
- Constructor
- Modifiers
- Contract inheritance

### 2. Data Types
- Value Types
  - Boolean (bool)
  - Integers (int/uint)
  - Address (address)
  - Fixed-size byte arrays (bytes1-bytes32)
- Reference Types
  - Arrays
  - Structs
  - Mappings
- Data Location
  - storage
  - memory
  - calldata

### 3. Functions
- Function declaration and definition
- Visibility
  - public
  - private
  - internal
  - external
- State Mutability
  - view
  - pure
  - payable
- Function modifiers
- Return value handling

### 4. Events
- Event definition and emission
- Event parameters
  - indexed
  - non-indexed
- Event listening and filtering

### 5. Error Handling
- require statements
- revert statements
- assert statements
- try/catch structure
- Custom errors

## Learning Order

1. Start with contract structure to understand the basic framework
2. Learn data types to master data storage
3. Deep dive into functions to understand contract interactions
4. Get familiar with events for contract notifications
5. Master error handling to improve code robustness

## Practice Tips

- Try writing simple example code after learning each concept
- Use Remix IDE for online compilation and testing
- Start with simple contracts and gradually increase complexity
- Pay attention to compiler warnings and error messages

## Start Learning

Choose any topic from the basic concepts above to begin learning. Each topic includes detailed example code and explanations.

Remember: Building a solid foundation is key to becoming an excellent smart contract developer!
